# Performance Docs

This folder contains performance-specific planning notes, baseline strategy, and case studies.

## Documents

- `performance-baseline-plan.md`: performance harness design, dataset tiers, measurement model, interaction probes, budget workflow, and run commands.
- `performance-dataset-strategy-for-bioinformaticians.md`: bioinformatics-facing explanation of why we use both synthetic and real datasets.
- `synthetic-performance-dataset-generation.md`: exact generation recipes and review notes for synthetic graph, FASTA, and Newick performance fixtures.
- `dunes-performance-fixture-generation.md`: optional forked DUNES workflow for generating simpler FASTA-only simulated sequence fixtures.
- `realistic-performance-fixture-generation.md`: optional MuSSE + AliSim workflow for generating bio-realistic simulated FASTA/Newick/metadata fixtures.
- `realistic-fixture-developer-setup.md`: developer setup/runbook for installing R, IQ-TREE/AliSim, R packages, generating fixtures, and running the opt-in Cypress spec.
- `genetic-distance-refactor-performance-comparison.md`: before/after performance results for the genetic-distance and Newick/patristic refactor comparison.
- `fasta-statistics-wasm-measurement.md`: FASTA/statistics timing evidence and Wasm recommendation from the expanded sequence harness.
- `problem-10k-node-only-performance.md`: case study for the 10k node-only fixture and 2D grouping/rendering improvements.

Generated Cypress artifacts still live under `cypress/downloads/performance/` and are intentionally not committed.
