# 2D Network Cypress E2E Checklist

Current on `cypressTesting` as of 2026-04-09.

Companion QA tracker: `docs/testing/views/2d-network/2d-network-cypress-qa-tracker.csv`

App-wide bug log: `docs/testing/app-wide-cypress-bug-log.csv`

Architecture reference: `docs/testing/cypress-architecture.md`

Update this checklist, the QA tracker, and the app-wide bug log together when coverage or known product behavior changes.

## Purpose

This checklist is the target end-to-end coverage for the 2D Network using Cypress journeys.

Use it to track three things:

- `[x]` Covered by a current Cypress flow on uploaded data.
- `[ ]` Missing or only partially covered and still needs a dedicated journey.
- `Fixture gap` means the product path exists, but the repo does not yet have the right small fixture to test it well.

The preferred pattern for every item below is:

- load real fixture files through the Files view
- launch into 2D Network
- drive General Settings or 2D Settings through the UI
- assert visible DOM stats and rendered Cytoscape state
- use `observed` vs `intended` expectations when current behavior is known to differ from product intent

Maintained suite structure:

- `cypress/e2e/ingestion/`
  - maintained file upload and file settings coverage
- `cypress/e2e/journeys/flows/`
  - uploaded-data 2D end-to-end behavior
- `cypress/e2e/view-state/`
  - sample-data or seeded 2D control mechanics
- `cypress/e2e/legacy-disabled/`
  - retired or fixture-broken specs excluded from the maintained run

## 1. Load To 2D Baseline Matrix

- [x] Distance edgelist -> launch -> 2D smoke.
- [x] Distance matrix -> launch -> 2D smoke.

## 2. General Settings: Filtering

- [x] Threshold change updates visible links on a grouped TN93 network.

- [x] Node size variable from style renders correctly in Cytoscape.
- [x] Link color variable from style renders correctly in Cytoscape.
- [x] Expected style tables open after applying style.
- [x] Background color change updates the 2D canvas.
- [x] Selected color change updates rendered selected-node styling.

## 8. Cross-Feature Combination Journeys

- [x] Sequence-derived TN93 network -> group by subtype -> change threshold -> change group colors -> verify polygons and counts.
- [x] Style dataset -> apply style -> change Minimum Cluster Size -> verify styling and tables still match visible nodes and links.
- [x] Style dataset -> apply style -> open 2D settings -> change node label and tooltip -> verify style and labels coexist.
- [x] Mixed-origin dataset -> threshold change -> Nearest Neighbor -> reveal -> verify counts and origins remain correct.
- [x] Newick dataset -> launch 2D -> adjust one 2D link setting -> verify parsed distance links behave correctly.

## 9. Export And Session
